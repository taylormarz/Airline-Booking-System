Authors:  Amanda Gurney,  Taylor Martin,  Ethan Sylvester

AUTHOR NOTES:

** Important Set Up Instructions **

If you are having trouble launching this program, look at your project directory in IntelliJ 
and check if there is a 'yellow' highlight anywhere. If there is, please right click on the 
highest level of the highlighted directory, look for 'Mark Directory As', and click 
'Cancel Exclusion'. This should resolve any issue.


** Ideal Viewing Environment **

Each scene is set to be 1250px x 800px, so this program is best viewed on a screen that can 
accommodate that sizing. Users cannot resize the programs interface, to avoid breaks in the 
design and formatting.

APPLICATION FUNCTIONALITY:

-- Home Page --

When the user launches the program, they're presented with the 'home page'. Here, they can see 
a user profile bar, a navigation bar, and an image with the GBC Airlines logo.

The user will always have access to their user profile and navigation bar throughout the program, 
with only the right panel screen changing as they navigate through different tabs.


-- User Profile Bar --

The 'user profile bar' is an added feature that allows the user to modify their username, job title, 
and change their password. The user can click any of these three buttons, and will be presented with 
a pop up dialog box where they can enter new information.

Although the password can be changed, there is no visual change in the user bar showing a different 
password as this is only a demo of that feature. The user will also find an 'Exit Button' in the user 
bar that they can click and exit the program at anytime.


-- Navigation Bar --

The 'navigation bar' is visible across all scenes, and allows the user to switch between scenes with 
a mouse click.


-- Add Flight -- 

This function of the program is an added feature that allows the user to create a new amandaTaylorEthanFlight within
the system. We figured this was a nice additional feature, instead of instantiating amandaTaylorEthanFlight objects within
the code itself. The user can set a 4-digit Flight number, a Flight date (dates prior to the system date are not allowed, as logically it would not make sense), a Flight source (country Flight is leaving from), Flight destination (where is the Flight going), and the maximum number of Passengers the Flight can hold. When the user clicks the 'submit' button, the Flight is added to an array list and saved in a txt file. A pop up informs the user that the Flight was added to the system successfully.


-- Add New Passenger to System --

This function allows the user to add a new amandaTaylorEthanPassenger to the GBC Airlines booking system. When a new Passenger is added, they remain in the system and can be assigned to specified Flights. The user enters a 4-digit passport number, the Passengers first and last name, their age, the cost of their ticket, and then chooses whether or not the Passengers booking has been confirmed. This is done by clicking the 'Yes' or 'No' button. Then the user clicks the 'submit' 
button and the Passenger is added to an array list and saved to a txt file. A pop up informs the user that the Passenger was added to the system successfully.


-- Add Passenger to Flight Manifest --

In this function the user adds a specified Passenger to a Flight manifest. The user can review the available Flights that are in the system (this information is being populated by loading the Flights.txt file into the listview element on the page). When the user decides on the Flight, they enter the Flight number and user they wish to add. They then click the 'Add Passenger to Flight Manifest' button. A pop informs the user that the Passenger was successfully added to the Flight.


-- Passenger Booking Confirmation --

This function shows the user a list of Passengers that is populated by loading the Passengers.txt file into the listview element on the page. However, only Passengers with a booking confirmation of 'false' appear. Because this functions purpose is to confirm bookings, it would not make sense to show amandaTaylorEthanPassengers who are already confirmed. The user can enter the passport number of the Passenger they wish to confirm, and then they click the 'submit' button. Confirming a Passengers booking will change their confirmation to true, remove them from the listview in this tab, and add them to the listview of the cancellation tab.


-- Cancel Booking Confirmation --

The cancel booking function allows the user to cancel the booking confirmation of Passengers who have previously confirmed their booking. The listview on this page shows only customers with a 'true' booking confirmation. Once the user enters the Passengers passport number into the text field and clicks the 'submit' button, the Passenger's booking becomes 'false', they're removed from this list view, and become visible inthe booking confirmation tab's list.


-- Print Flight Manifest --

In this function, the user is presented with a list of Flights registered in the system. The user can enter the Flight number of the Flight they wish to see the manifest of, click submit, and then the bottom listview element is populated with all Passengers on this Flight. If there are no Passengers assigned to a Flight number that has been entered, a pop up box alerts the user that there are no Passengers currently on this Flight.


-- View Bookings from Last Seven Days -- 
 
This is a simple function that the user can go to and review a list of Passengers that have been added to the system from the last 7 days. Passengers who were added prior to seven days are not visible in the list.
